For some time now it’s been obvious that Rishi Sunak really doesn’t want to be prime minister any more. You can see it in his body language. Defeat hangs heavy around his shoulders. Despair etched into the lines on his face. He is desperate for it all to end. Then he can be shot of the lot of us. Kiss goodbye to us miserable ingrates and take his millions off to California.

But credit where credit is due. No one can accuse Rish! of not putting the hours in. He has gone well beyond the call of duty. The efforts to ensure his self-destruction have become almost superhuman. His commitment to the cause total. He will stick at nothing until his failure is complete. All hope of recovery vanquished. In this he has almost reached the status of a performance artist. Marina Abramović is nothing on Sunak. She would have flinched long ago. The greater the self-inflicted pain, the nobler the victory.

On Tuesday I suggested that Sunak’s aides must be secret Labour stooges. I now see this was a mistake. Classic diversionary tactics from the master illusionist. Rather, it is Rish! who has been the undercover agent all along. It had been his idea to stage a car crash at Silverstone. To present a demotivational manifesto, devoid of any intellectual rigour, that was dead on arrival. Designed to plunge his party into a vortex of misery, stripped of all hope. Desolation row.

That might have been enough, for the time being, for some party leaders. A moment to bask in the glory of Project Rish!. But Sunak just keeps it coming. Feeding the media with stories of his own stupidity. He is a man who will not rest until the whole country celebrates the Triumph of the Quarter-Wit. Every time you think he can’t get worse, Rish! says “Hold my Mexican full-fat Coke”.

We’ve now been gifted the first of clips of Paul Brand’s ITV interview with the prime minister. The one he rushed back from the D-day commemorations to record. What very Heaven to be alive at such a time. Howard Carter never glimpsed such treasures when he discovered Tutankhamun’s tomb.

“I’m sorry I’m a bit late,” Rish! said. “I couldn’t get away.” Such charm. Such grace. You know how it is. You get stuck with some dreary 100-year-old war veterans. What a nuisance. Why do they insist on making such a fuss about a military campaign that took place 80 years previously? You’d have thought they might have got over it by now. Then there was Emmanuel Macron. So needy. Wanted to hang around and chat. Yawn. Thank God he’d managed to give a swerve to Joe Biden and Olaf Scholz. What had their war dead ever done for him?

There was more. Much more. Now the sob story. The crippling levels of deprivation he had suffered as a child. To live in a home with no Sky TV. Largely because Sky dishes were considered to be a bit common back then. But the shame nonetheless. The tears were all too real. I felt his pain. I grew up with no colour TV. Largely because it hadn’t been invented. The damage lingers to this day. Rish! looked bashfully towards the camera. Maybe this would be his cut-through to the public. When he forged an emotional connection. When the country fell in love with him.

Or maybe not. Rather it was the moment when the rest of the Conservatives abandoned hope. Even Grant Shapps. That most comical of optimists. There could be no more shape shifting. No more quick changes into Michael Green, Sebastian Fox or Corinne Stockheath. He, too, was crushed. Sent out to defend the government, he merely raised the white flag. It was over, he said. His party and his career were in tatters. All that could now be salvaged was to minimise the loss. To try to hold on to at least 100 seats. That would be something. But not his. Any openings for a secondhand defence secretary?

Some things never change, though. The Greens have always had an endearingly low-key approach to their manifesto launches – they are fantastically grateful if anyone from the media shows up – and Wednesday’s was no exception. This election found us in Cow Corner – not very vegan – at the Sussex County Cricket Club in Brighton. Where else? A modestly sized hut on the boundary’s edge.

On arrival we were greeted by the sight of the joint leaders, Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, practising their lines with the teleprompter. I doubt we’ll catch Keir Starmer doing a public rehearsal when Labour launches its manifesto tomorrow. I say joint leaders because that’s their official job description, but in reality Carla seems to be prima inter pares. She’s the one who seems to do most of the glad-handing. Not that Adrian looks at all bothered. He appears laid-back, almost sleepy. No sharp elbows on him.
